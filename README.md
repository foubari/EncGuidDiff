## ðŸ”½ Download Saved Models

The pretrained models are too large to be included in the repository.

You can download the zipped models manually from the following Google Drive link:

ðŸ‘‰ [Download `saved_models.zip`](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1gdDOvhcgFQlIAzF5UrSM937tYornrj4b)

Once downloaded, unzip it and place the contents into the same folder as the notebook (`./results/`).
